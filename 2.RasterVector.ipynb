    "##Map Projections\n",
    "---\n",
    "Earth is not a Plane surface but the maps we see are printed on 2D paper. Have you wondered how this can be achieved? The answer is, earth surface is projected to a plane surface and it is scaled down to small Paper size(like A0). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, lets us discuss different types of projections. But why do we need different types of projections? Our Earth is not smooth Spherical in shape as we see in movies. When only the terrain is mapped earth looks like a crushed paper ball [Earth IMG](https://images.app.goo.gl/8HiHxPMbW8p1obg89). \n",
    "\n",
    "So it is obvious that a single projection cannot be used across the globe to map all the features. Projection are chosen by considering which property of the geographical features to be conserved such as *area, shape, distance, or direction*. All four properties cannot be conserved in one projection, so the projection has to be chosen based on what property is more important to be conserved. Also, the surface onto which the features are projected plays an important role. Diffrent types of surfaces are Conical, Cylindrical, Planar.\n",
    "\n",

    "*   Counties near the polar regions  (Greenland, New Zealand) follow **Conical projection**.\n",

    "the reference system for the Global Positioning System (GPS). So the best fit of the entire globe is WGS 84.  But to get more accurate information about any location we have to choose the projection as discussed earlier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data collected for a project can be from different sources hence they all may not be on the same projection, it is very important to only overlay and compare maps of the same projection, or to calculate distance or area in metric units from decimal coordinate system projection WGS 84 transformation is used.  This leads to the concept of **Transformation**\n",
    "\n",
    "##Transformation. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing from one coordinate reference system to another is called Transformation. While opening a map in any GIS software such as (ArcMap) the first map loaded in a project will be taken as the reference coordinate system and the other maps loaded will be automatically projected to previous layer projection. Hence it is very important to check the projection of all maps and project it to the same coordinate system before working on them. \n",
    "Now what to do if the cell size doesn't be same on diffrent Raster ? We have to do **Resampling**\n",

    "The process of deriving pixel values for a new image from an existing image is called as resampling. For Example in NDBI, We are about to compute with Bands SWIR1375, NIR which of resolution 20m and 10m respectively. Hence SWIR1375 is Resampled to match the NIR resolution using **nearest neighbor** \n",
