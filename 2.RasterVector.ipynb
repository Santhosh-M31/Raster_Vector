Have you wondered how this can be achieved? The answer is, earth surface is projected to a plane surface and it is scaled down to small Paper size(like A0). \n","\n","Now, lets us discuss different types of projections. But why do we need different types of projections? Our Earth is not smooth Spherical in shape as we see in movies. When only the terrain is mapped earth looks like a crushed paper ball [Earth IMG](https://images.app.goo.gl/8HiHxPMbW8p1obg89). \n","\n","So it is obvious that a single projection cannot be used across the globe to map all the features. Projection are chosen by considering which property of the geographical features to be conserved such as *area, shape, distance, or direction*. All four properties cannot be conserved in one projection, so the projection has to be chosen based on what property is more important to be conserved. Also, the surface onto which the features are projected plays an important role. Diffrent types of surfaces are Conical, Cylindrical, Planar.\n","\n","\n","*   Counties near the polar regions  (Greenland, New Zealand) follow **Conical projection**.\n","*   Countries near Equator (Brazil) follow **Cylindrical projection**.\n","*   Poles are projected by **Planar/Azimuthal projection**.\n","\n","[Projection IMG](https://images.app.goo.gl/MmBMubQMyhw7EGNB9).\n","\n","To further understand this concept lets learn about **coordinate reference system**\n","\n","##Coordinate Reference System\n","\n","---\n","*A system used to register and measure horizontal and vertical distance on a map ~ C.P. Lo*\n","\n","It is a coordinate-based local, regional, or global system used to locate geographical features.  Also, it defines a specific map projection, as well as transformations between different reference systems\n","\n","WGS 84 is a coordinate reference system that is developed by the U.S. Department of Defense. It can also be said as a \"global reference system\" for geospatial information and is\n","the reference system for the Global Positioning System (GPS). So the best fit of the entire globe is WGS 84.  But to get more accurate information about any location we have to choose the projection as discussed earlier. \n","\n","Data collected for a project can be from different sources hence they all may not be on the same projection, it is very important to only overlay and compare maps of the same projection, or to calculate distance or area in metric units from decimal coordinate system projection WGS 84 transformation is used.  This leads to the concept of **Transformation**\n","\n","##Transformation. \n","\n","---\n","\n","Changing from one coordinate reference system to another is called Transformation. While opening a map in any GIS software such as (ArcMap) the first map loaded in a project will be taken as the reference coordinate system and the other maps loaded will be automatically projected to previous layer projection. Hence it is very important to check the projection of all maps and project it to the same coordinate system before working on them. \n","\n","Thus we have discussed briefly Map Projection, Coordinate Reference System, and why Transformation is important. \n","\n","Next lets us discuss about Calculation of Indices. \n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"KVu8Bs-_NB8N","colab_type":"text"},"source":["##INDICES\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qPKaag0xMU66","colab_type":"text"},"source":["###Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)\n","---\n","NDVI is the most commonly used vegetation index for monitoring the condition of vegetation/health of plantation.\n","\n","This is calculated using Satellite imagery (Sentinal, LandSat, Cartosat.. ) which is capable of capturing information in multispectral bands. \n","\n","*Formula:* $NDVI = \\frac{\\left(NIR - Red\\right)} {\\left(NIR + Red\\right)}$\n","\n","Red band and NIR band are used to calculate the index.
